## Exploring Weather Trends

This project is part of the tasks in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, and aims to practice the skills learned during the course.

In this project, I analyzed Guarulhos city and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends that Guarulhos to overall global temperature trends.

The data was extracted from a Udacity SQL Server saved in the `data` folder in csv format.

The whole project is developed within [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and the data is imported and worked using the [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) of the [Python language ](https://www.python.org/).
